# kerala-flood-prediction
This project involves building simple Machine Learning models to predict flood occurence in Kerala (India) based on monthly rainfall data of over 100 years from the said region. It employs and compares classification algorithms such as KNeighborsClassifier, LogisticRegression, SupportVectorClassifier, and DecisionTreeClassifier, in order to predict the likelihood of flooding in the region per year.
